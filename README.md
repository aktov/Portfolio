**Doubling as my portfolio, this project was my first on-hands experience with React.js!**

## Final Thoughts
It was frustrating at first learning it (all the compile errors), but after trial and error, and much help
from the react docs, I eventually got the hang of basic functions and structures. I can definitely say that
building this site was so much easier than my past projects. Those were pure HTML pages and I would have to keep 
track of multiple pages. This however was just a single page application; react router was incredibly helpful for
simulating a multiple page application. Components made this project so much more efficient and clean than my 
old tactic of copy/pasting entire HTML chunks to duplicate an element.

## Plugins Used
I'd like to thank the creators of these plugins for already inventing the wheel.
