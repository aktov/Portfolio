this collaboration with Okizeme, I developed better skills for the UI portion of UI/UX Design. \r\n                I've always been confident in claiming that UI Design is different from graphics/marketing design, and although it is canonically, I would be lying if I said\r\n                that there was no overlap.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                While designing the layout of a webpage or app screen, it's important to focus on location and ease of access first, however the visual aesthetics of the design is equally as\r\n                pivotal in user satisfaction and ultimately retention. \r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <b> The design of a website or app should exemplify the company's brand and purpose.  </b>\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                In the same way that a Dyson or Apple advertisement screams their name, despite their minimalistic style, a company — or at least their brand — should be recognizeable from their sites or apps.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <TopButton

Throughout the years, the Cambodian Student \r\n                Association has developed a culture that resembles a close knit family and strives to support one another. \r\n                CSA has also built ties with off-campus Khmer (Cambodian) communities in Southern California. \r\n              </p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <h4 className='subheading'> USERS </h4>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Our client has a very clear mission and audience in mind for their org.

Using the country as a common interest, they want \r\n                to reach out to the public and raise awareness of their presence in the country, as well as the world. \r\n                Keeping the culture and traditions of Cambodia as a centerpiece, they want to highlight their history, as \r\n                well as their involvement with other Cambodian organizations.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <h4 className='subheading'> CONTENT </h4>\r\n              <p>\r\n                As a student organization, CSA holds general body meetings which are often themed and feature icebreakers \r\n                and games, and also hosts socials and even language lessons occasionally. The org also has big events where \r\n                they receive sponsorships and make money by selling food through fundraising on campus and campus events. \r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When asked specifically what content they would like on the website, the client requested that about 25% \r\n                of the website should be on the history/background on Cambodia and the remaining 75% should be on content \r\n                regarding the org, such as: the mission statement, an introduction to CSA, a section for the weekly/biweekly \r\n                newsletter, announcements, upcoming events, and their google calendar. In particular, they wanted to highlight \r\n                the upcoming Annual Culture Show.

We wanted to design a site that\r\n                would leave those users with a lasting impression.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                When it comes to a team working together on a project, there are bound to be some inconsistencies\r\n                with stylings and conflicts when it comes to whose idea to use. This project taught me how to deal with\r\n                sitations like these, and the importance of team communcation and management.
